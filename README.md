## Project 1: Rocks and Mines Classification
_Machine Learning Project: Sonar dataset classification. Supervised, metaclassifiers and unsupervised algorithm in R._

Application of Machine Learning procedures to assess a binary classification problem: determine whether an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles of measuremement.
This work will explore and compare different classification methods with the aim to show the one that gives the most accurate and reliable results in this particular application. To accomplish this, unsupervised and supervised approaches are used, including meta classifiers.
