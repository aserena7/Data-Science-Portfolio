## [MSc Data Science Thesis](https://github.com/aserena7/MSc_Thesis)
**Machine learning applied to COVID-19**
*COVID-19 pandemic from a data science point of view.*  
I've discussed the most recent breakthroughs in 2020 that applied machine learning to fight COVID-19, highlighting achievements and challenges of the machine learning tools used in diagnosis, screening, contact tracing, drugs and vaccine development, prediction and forecasting.  
On top of that I performed a SWOT analysis and provided the starting points for future studies and improvements.

## [Project 1: Rocks and Mines Classification](https://github.com/aserena7/Rocks_Mines_Classification)
_Machine Learning Project: Sonar dataset classification. Supervised, metaclassifiers and unsupervised algorithm in R._

Application of Machine Learning procedures to assess a binary classification problem: determine whether an object is a mine or a rock given the strength of sonar returns at different angles of measuremement.  
 This work will explore and compare different classification methods with the aim to show the one that gives the most accurate and reliable results in this particular application.  To accomplish this, unsupervised and supervised approaches are used, including meta classifiers.

## [Project 2: Deep Neural Networks for California Housing Prices](https://github.com/aserena7/Deep_Neural_Network)
_Deep Learning Project - Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. California Housing Prices classification task using a Deep ANN in Python._

In this work is performed the whole process to build a deep neural network from scratch.  
The goal is to classify the observations of MedianHouseValue dataset in one of the 4 classes that describe the approximate locations of a house in California.   
 Several nets have been built to select the one that performs better according the accuracy value and the balance between bias and variance.    
Batch normalization, L1/L2 Regularizers and Initializer are also used to improve results.

## [Project 3: Deep Neural Networks for California Housing Prices](https://github.com/aserena7/Object_Recognition)
_Computer Vision Project - Feed-Forward Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow._

The aim of this work is to solve several computer vision problems using deep models:  
• Develop proficiency in using Keras for training and testing neural nets (NNs).  
• Optimize the parameters and architectures of a dense feed-forward neural network (ffNN), and a convolutional neural net (CNN) for image classification.  
• Build a traffic sign detection algorithm.

## [Project 4: Breast Cancer Bayesian Networks](https://github.com/aserena7/Bayesian_Networks_Breast_Cancer)
_Machine Learning Project: Structure Learning, Parameters Learning and Inference in R._

Learning and inferencing the Bayesian Network built for the original wisconsin breast cancer dataset.  
This work will explore the different methods to learn the strucuture and the parameters of a Bayesian Network to select the model that fits better the breast cancer data.  
• To learning the structure both Search+Score and Constraint-Based approach are performed.  
• To learning the parameters Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Based Estimation are used. Once obtained the Bayesian network, exact and approximate inference are performed.  
It's possible, for example, having an idea about the probability of having breast cancer before to do the biopsy to diagnostic the nature of the tumor. The inference is based on the question *"What is it the probability of having breast cancer, given the results of a mammography?"*
